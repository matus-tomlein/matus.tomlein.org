Despite of the advancements in information and telecommunication technologies, slow and intermittent Internet connection is still a serious issue in many places around the World, but mostly in developing countries. At the same time, Internet with its most popular service – the Web, became one of the very important parts of our everyday lives as more and more of human activity is taking place online. We believe that providing access to information on the Web is crucial for young people in developing countries to get the required skills and acquire experience in order to finally achieve significant progress in solving problems of their countries. In this paper, we propose a concept of software solution called OwNet which makes the Web surfing experience less frustrating even on slow and intermittent Internet connections. OwNet is based on using a local proxy server, which acts as an intelligent bridge between the client’s browser application and the Internet and communicates with other clients and services in order to provide the best surfing experience. Although this concept is not bound to the quality of available connection, we mainly target the current situation in developing countries. The paper presents the overall concept and details on methods used for intelligent caching and prefetching of Web content.

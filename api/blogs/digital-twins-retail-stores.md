As a grad student, I worked on a research project that contributed to the Industry
4.0 initiative. Industry 4.0 builds on advancements in Cloud Computing,
Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things (IoT) to create **smart factories** with a
high degree of automation, ability to self-adapt to changes over time and customise
their behaviour to address specific user needs. One of the key building blocks of
Industry 4.0 is the concept of **Digital Twins**.

[Digital Twins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896315003808) are models that enable a high-degree of awareness of physical processes
and activities happening at factories in real-time. Such **context-awareness** can
support a wide range of activities from production planning to maintenance and
optimisation of production lines. Granular data from sensors placed around industrial
systems supports simulation of their operation and prediction of future events. It
can be used to predict future condition of industrial machines which enables their
maintenance to be scheduled before it is too late. Awareness of events and processes
that happen in factories is instrumental to the vision of smart factories.

At Pygmalios, we take a similar approach to transition traditional brick and mortar
shops to take part in the [Retail 4.0](https://pygmalios.com/blog/retail-4-0). **Awareness** of activities and behaviour of
customers inside stores is crucial to enable store-owners improve the shopping
experience and revenue of their stores. And there is no better way to gain this
awareness than to use real-time and granular data from **IoT sensors**. Data about paths
of customers in stores, their demography and purchases provide similar value for
improving retail stores as contextual data from factories has for improving
production lines. The possibilities as well as the challenges are endless, which is
also why I am excited to [work at Pygmalios](https://pygmalios.com/career/).

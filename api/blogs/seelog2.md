In times when our travels are restricted, it is nice to look back on our past adventures and find new opportunities to explore in our surroundings.
The new version of Seelog, Seelog 2, comes with a new look and more insights into your travels close and far.
It is now available for [download on the App Store.](https://seelog.app)

On a technical level, the new UI of Seelog 2 was rewritten from scratch using SwiftUI.
It was fun learning the new framework, and, despite being relatively new, it turned out to be pretty powerful.
In fact, there is no remaining UIKit code in Seelog and SwiftUI even made it easier to create
custom visualizations such as the new maps that are purely drawn using polygons and
basic shapes in SwiftUI.

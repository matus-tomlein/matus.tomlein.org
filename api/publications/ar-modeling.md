This paper proposes and evaluates an approach for building models of installed industrial Cyber-Physical Systems using augmented reality on smartphones.
It proposes a visual language for annotating devices, containers, flows of liquids and networking connections in augmented reality.
Compared to related work, it provides a more lightweight and flexible approach for building 3D models of industrial systems.
The models are further used to automatically infer software configuration of controllable industrial products.
This addresses a common problem of error-prone and time-consuming configuration of industrial systems in the current practice.
The proposed approach is evaluated in a study with 16 domain experts.
The study participants are involved in creating a model of an industrial system for water treatment.
Their comments show that the approach can enable a less error-prone configuration for more complex systems.
Opportunities for improvement in usability and reflections on the potential of the approach are discussed.

    The video shows the app in use on an industrial system for water treatment.
    The same task as shown in the video was carried out by 16 domain experts in a user study discussed in the paper.

      "perex": "Misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious threat to public health as well as spreads stigma and fear. Recognizing this threat, numerous fact checking sites continuously monitor misinformation related to the disease and publish information fact-checked by experts. Exploring this knowledge base of fact checks provides potential for better understanding how misinformation regarding COVID-19 evolves and relates to other content. CovidMis.info is a website that aims to support the exploration of fact checks and related Web articles. It builds on Monant, a platform for crawling and processing misinformation-related data from the Web. Based on the data, it provides visualizations of relations between fact checks and fact checks and Web articles."

      "perex": "Smartphones make it easy to track your steps, runs, sleep, or time spent using apps. But getting data on which countries, cities, timezones, and places you visited is a bigger challenge. Your main options are to log your travels manually, give third-parties access to your emails with travel reservations, or run apps that track your GPS location 24/7 for years. Suffice it to say that none of these options are great.\n\nThere is one obvious source of data that is rarely used: photos. Most people take photos when they travel, and many of them use smartphones or cameras that store geotags along with the photos. This is an amazing source of data as it doesn't require additional tracking or manual input, and many of us have already collected a good amount of the data without even thinking about it. Your photo library app can use the geotags to show you photos placed on a map, but there is so much more you can do with the data. For instance, I'd be interested in how many countries I visited last year versus the previous year, which cities I spent most time in, and which timezones I was in."

      "perex": "Having some large retail stores with lots of daily shoppers as customers at [Pygmalios](https://pygmalios.com/), we were faced with a new problem — how to visualize thousands of shopping tracks in a way that would be useful for our users as well as computationally scalable.\n\nFor our smaller customers, we were able to provide visualisations showing trajectories of each individual track on top of a floor plan. By inspecting these trajectories, they could explore patterns in the behaviour of shoppers. However, visualisations of larger numbers of tracks were difficult to read. Overlapping tracks were hard to distinguish and finding frequent shopping paths wasn’t easy for the users."

      "perex": " As a grad student, I worked on a research project that contributed to the Industry 4.0 initiative. Industry 4.0 builds on advancements in Cloud Computing, Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things (IoT) to create smart factories with a high degree of automation, ability to self-adapt to changes over time and customise their behaviour to address specific user needs. One of the key building blocks of Industry 4.0 is the concept of Digital Twins.\n\n[Digital Twins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896315003808) are models that enable a high-degree of awareness of physical processes and activities happening at factories in real-time. Such context-awareness can support a wide range of activities from production planning to maintenance and optimisation of production lines. Granular data from sensors placed around industrial systems supports simulation of their operation and prediction of future events. It can be used to predict future condition of industrial machines which enables their maintenance to be scheduled before it is too late. Awareness of events and processes that happen in factories is instrumental to the vision of smart factories."

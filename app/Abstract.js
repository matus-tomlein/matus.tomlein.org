    I am heading data science efforts at <a href="https://pygmalios.com">Pygmalios</a>, a retail analytics startup.
    Our mission is to use data from sensors to empower store operators and managers.
    I am also working as a researcher on misinformation and online malicious behavior detection, previously at <a href="https://kinit.sk/index.php/en/site/index">Slovak University of Technology</a> and currently at <a href="https://kinit.sk/index.php/en/site/index">Kempelen Institute of Intelligent Technology</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    I completed my Ph.D. within Industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 at Aarhus University, supervised by Kaj Grønbæk.
    I was a visiting researcher at Anind Dey’s lab at Carnegie Mellon University, working on activity recognition using IoT sensors.
